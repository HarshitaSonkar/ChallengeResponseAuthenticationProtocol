# Challenge_Response_Authentication_Mechanism
Implemention of the Challenege-Response based entity authentication protocols between two physical computers. 
One computer should act as the User (Claimant) and the other-one should act as Authentication Server (Verifier). The protocol must have three modules : 
1) Registration Module: using which a new user can register itself to the server and 
2) Authentication Module: using which a registered user can authenticate itself to the server, 
3) Renewal Module: using which a registered user can renew itâ€™s security credentials (passwords, symmetric keys, public keys etc.). 
Measure the average End-to-End Authentication Delay for your authentication module. 
End-to-End Authentication Delay is defined as the duration of time starting from the instant when the user initiates the authentication process to the instant when the user gets the authentication Success/Failure message from the verifier.
